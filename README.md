A Scalable Angular Boiler Plate, contains all the necessary files and folders to start a new project without needing to create them from scratch. 
It also contains a lot of features that are required in most of the projects including authentication, lazy loading, guards, etc.
### This boilerplate includes the following features:


- [x] Scalable folder structure.
- [x] Separation of concerns (Adapting [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)).
- [x] Modularization of components, services, pipes, directives, etc.
- [x] [Lazy loading](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules) of modules.
- [x] [Routing](https://angular.io/guide/router) with [guards](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate).
- [x] Complete authentication system (Auth service, guard, interceptors etc ).
- [x] Authentication with [JWT](https://jwt.io/).
- [x] [Guards](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate) for authentication and authorization.
- [x] [Interceptors](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor).
- [x] Error handling.
- [x] Class based entities. (Adapting [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)).
- [x] Implementation of [Class Transformers](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer) so that we can transform our entities to and from backend data models. Usually apis return data in snake case and we need to 
  convert them to camel case and vice versa.
- [x] Environments for development and production.
- [x] Utility functions for common tasks.
- [x] Helper functions for common tasks.

And many more...

Please note that this boilerplate is not a complete solution for all the projects. It is just a starting point for your project.
You can use this boilerplate as a starting point for your project and then add or remove features as per your requirements.
The features and folder structure of this boilerplate are based on my experience of working on several projects.

This boilerplate will remain updated with the latest versions of Angular and other dependencies.
It will also be updated with new features as they are required in most of the projects.
