Get started fast with this **Angular 19** boilerplate, crafted for **enterprise-level scalability**. It integrates critical features like **authentication**, **lazy loading**, **real-time socket communication**, **service workers**, **shell layout (header+sidebar)** making it ready to handle everything from SaaS platforms to enterprise dashboards. Built on the latest **Angular 19**, this template is packed with the newest capabilities and ensures that you adhere to **modern development best practices**.

With a solid foundation of **PWA (Progressive Web App)**, **authentication**, **role-based permissions**, **HTTP interceptors**, **socket integration**, and more, this boilerplate takes care of the core setup so you can focus on building features.

### Key Features:

- [x] **Angular 19**: Built with the latest version, utilizing improved standalone components and reactive forms.
- [x] **PWA (Progressive Web App) support**: Fully configured to enable offline capabilities, background sync, and push notifications.
- [x] **Scalable folder structure**: Optimized for enterprise-level applications with a modular design that adapts to growing project needs.
- [x] **Separation of concerns**: Adopting [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) for a clear boundary between business logic and infrastructure code.
- [x] **Modularization**: Components, services, pipes, and directives are split into reusable modules for easy maintenance and scalability.
- [x] **Hybrid architecture**: Combines both standalone components and module-based structure, optimizing the initial app component as standalone and using modules for pages and shell.
- [x] **[Lazy loading](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules)**: Efficiently loads only the necessary modules, improving app performance.
- [x] **[Routing with guards](https://angular.io/guide/router)**: Robust routing system with [authentication and authorization guards](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate) for secured navigation.
- [x] **Complete authentication system**: Pre-configured JWT-based authentication, including services, guards, and interceptors for seamless integration.
- [x] **[Guards](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate)**: Role-based guards to protect routes and enforce permissions.
- [x] **[Interceptors](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor)**: Secure API communication with interceptors handling authentication and error management.
- [x] **i18n Translation support**: Full [internationalization](https://angular.io/guide/i18n) for multi-language apps, with seamless integration of translation services.
- [x] **Basic error handling**: Centralized error handling for smooth debugging and a better user experience.
- [x] **Class-based entities**: Utilizing [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) concepts for consistent and maintainable entity structures.
- [x] **Implementation of [Class Transformers](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer)**: Easily transform backend data models to frontend-friendly formats (e.g., snake_case to camelCase).
- [x] **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/) integration**: Real-time updates with modular socket services that seamlessly integrate with the Angular ecosystem.
- [x] **App updates in production**: Automatic app updates for production environments, ensuring users always get the latest features and fixes without manual intervention.
- [x] **Environments for development and production**: Predefined configurations for different environments, ensuring smooth deployment and testing processes.
- [x] **Utility functions**: A set of reusable functions to handle common tasks like:
  - **Local storage obfuscation**: Getters and setters that automatically encrypt and decrypt data in production environments.
- [x] **Helper functions**: Pre-configured helper functions for common development tasks, enhancing productivity and code quality.
- [x] **Detailed documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for setup, dependencies, coding styles, utility functions, and more, to help developers get up to speed quickly.
- [x] **Documented utility and helper functions**: Clearly explained and reusable across the application, with customization options.

### Development Best Practices

This boilerplate enforces **strict best practices** and includes a configured **ESLint flat config** to guide developers in writing clean, maintainable, and high-quality code:

- **Code Quality**: ESLint rules enforce coding standards like naming conventions, indentation, and eliminating unused code.
- **No Direct Service Access**: Encourages a clean architecture by requiring components to interact with data via **UseCases**, keeping the service layer isolated.
- **Modularization**: Promotes single-responsibility services, with each service handling only domain-specific tasks.
- **Scoped Variables**: Enforces scoped use of variables and functions, reducing the risk of global state conflicts.
- **Clean, Maintainable Code**: The **standalone component** and **module-based** hybrid structure optimizes performance and keeps the codebase organized.
- **DRY Principle**: Adheres to **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principles, reducing redundancy and improving the maintainability of code.
- **Security Awareness**: Built-in ESLint rules ensure you avoid common security pitfalls, ensuring secure and performant code.

### ESLint Configuration Highlights:

- **Strict Linting Rules**: Custom **ESLint flat config** enforces coding standards, ensuring consistent formatting and type checking across the codebase.
- **Prettier Integration**: Maintains consistent code styling with automatic formatting on save or commit.
- **Error Prevention**: Detects common issues early on, such as missing type declarations or direct DOM manipulations.
- **Security Focused**: The configuration includes security-related rules to avoid risky code patterns.

### Why Choose This Boilerplate?

This Angular 19 boilerplate goes beyond just being a starting template—it's a **fully equipped foundation** for any **enterprise-level project**. From **fully configured authentication** and **lazy loading** to **role-based permissions** and **real-time communication**, it covers the most common requirements out-of-the-box.

By enforcing **best coding practices** and strict **ESLint rules**, the boilerplate guarantees that every contributor to your project adheres to **high development standards**. Plus, the **modular, scalable architecture** and **cutting-edge Angular features** ensure that this project grows with you.

Whether you’re developing a SaaS platform, building a dynamic web app, or designing an enterprise-level solution, this boilerplate gives you the tools you need—fast.
